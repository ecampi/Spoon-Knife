I was thinking that I could do a project in a group. I am interested in working on a lot of projects and most parts of these projects, but I would prefer to work mostly in the back end (C++, python, Java...) part of the project. I would also like to get exposure to the front end of a project (like HTML code) because I haven't worked with it a lot. The only project areas I am not interested in doing is security and very complex games that require knowledge about gaming.
